    "content": "The wait is over for fans of European soccer, as 24 nations go in search of continental glory this summer at Euro 2024 in Germany.\n\nThe hosts' young squad, which includes the likes of Kai Havertz and Joshua Kimmich, will be aiming to win an unprecedented fourth title.\n\nItaly come into the tournament as defending champions, but it's Gareth Southgate's England, the team Italy beat in the 2020 final on penalties, that are widely regarded as the favorites to lift the trophy in Berlin.\n\nFrance, led by the mercurial Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, are also well fancied, with Real Madrid's new signing hoping to replicate his Golden Boot performance at the Qatar World Cup and spearhead Les Bleus to their third European Championship triumph.\n\nThe Euros have had their fair share of unfancied teams win the tournament in the past -- best exemplified by unlikely wins for Denmark in 1992 and Greece in 2004. Turkey are many pundits' dark horses to do well, thanks to young stars like Juventus' Kenan Y\u0131ld\u0131z and Real Madrid's Arda G\u00fcler.\n\nBelow, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch every game live, wherever you are in the world.\n\nThis year's tournament marks the second time the UEFA European Championships have been held in Germany.

A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.\n\nWith a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.\n\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\n\nLooking for other options?
