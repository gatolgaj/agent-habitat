    "content": "The Killers assisted UK fans in celebrating England\u2019s Euro 2024 semifinal victory yesterday by pausing their gig at London\u2019s O2 Arena to project the final moments of the game behind the band. Viral videos across X and Instagram captured the elation that followed as confetti showered the crowd during a rousing rendition of \u201cMr. Brightside\u201d \u2014 and now they\u2019re being taken offline by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA).\n\nAccording to an Instagram takedown notice seen by The Verge, UEFA says the removed videos include content that \u201cinfringes their copyright.\u201d Many of the impacted videos being pulled, such as a clip posted by photographer Bella Falk, contained mere seconds of the live match and are \u201ctransformative\u201d enough to fall under fair use. Falk says she\u2019s now \u201cbanned from Instagram for a month for copyright infringement,\u201d after her video was removed from the service.\n\nThe video embedded below remains active at the time of this writing, and shows the moment that The Killers kicked off the celebration.\n\nThe takedowns especially sting given the UK\u2019s fanatic obsession with The Killers. The band, and particularly its hit song \u201cMr. Brightside,\u201d has developed such a devout fanbase in Britain that it holds Guinness World Record titles for spending years in the UK charts. \u201cMr. Brightside\u201d is widely considered to be the country\u2019s unofficial national anthem, so to experience it live as England secured a place in the Euro finals must have been euphoric, countered only by the dull overreach of UEFA."
